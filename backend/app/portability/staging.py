"""The isolation boundary of an import: a staging database per import (docs/export-import-design.md §10.1).

An import is loaded, rebuilt and reconciled in a database of its own, never in the active one:

* `create` makes `argus_stage_<import>` on the active server (or the server of
  `ARGUS_PORTABILITY_STAGING_URL`) and migrates it to the current head.
* `seed` copies into it what the import must be reconciled against: the active workspaces the archive
  touches (an increment's earlier state, all of it), the portability row map and chain of the same
  origin, and every row those or the archive's rows refer to (types, owner workspaces, people,
  records in other workspaces), recursively.
* The load (`importer.execute`) runs there with durable, per-chunk checkpoints: an interrupted import
  resumes there, and nothing about it is visible to the active instance — not to its APIs, search,
  graph, AI retrieval, projectors, notifications or exports, which only ever read the active database.
* Finalization (`importer.promote`) loads the same verified archive into the active database in ONE
  transaction, rebuilds and reconciles there, and commits only when that result equals the staged
  one. Readers see all of it or none of it. Exports take their watermark lock before reading, so
  they wait for the promotion to commit or roll back.
* `drop` removes the staging database. A discard or failure never touches the active database.
