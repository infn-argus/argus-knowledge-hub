"""Generic OIDC ID-token verification, independent of the identity provider.

Configured entirely via env vars (issuer, JWKS URL, audience) so switching from
Firebase to INFN's Keycloak is a config change, not a rewrite: only these
three values differ between providers, everything downstream (the User/Membership
model, permission checks) reads the same decoded claims regardless of issuer.

Firebase example values:
  OIDC_ISSUER   = https://securetoken.google.com/<firebase-project-id>
  OIDC_JWKS_URI = https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com
  OIDC_AUDIENCE = <firebase-project-id>

More than one provider can be trusted at once — Firebase for the accounts that
already exist and INFN's own IdP beside it, say. The three variables above name
the first; any others go in OIDC_EXTRA_PROVIDERS as a JSON list:

  OIDC_EXTRA_PROVIDERS='[{"issuer": "...", "jwks_uri": "...", "audience": "..."}]'

A token is checked against the provider whose issuer it names, never tried
against each in turn: a token signed by one provider must not be accepted
because another provider's key happened to verify it.
