This topic is for administrators and the people who run the installation. What people may do is set in ARGUS;
the sign-in service only says who they are.

## The administration pages

For administrators, **Administration** (bottom of the side bar):

| Page | For |
|---|---|
| **Workspaces** | every workspace; **New workspace** |
| **Users** | everyone who has signed in; who is an administrator |
| **Settings** | how workspace identifiers are made from names (prefix, case, separator, length) |
| **AI** | the AI settings every workspace without its own uses (see *AI settings*) |
| **API tokens** | every personal and robot token: who made it, what it may do, expiry, last use; revoke any |
| **Portability** | exports and imports (see *Export and import*) |

## The production installation

| | Address |
|---|---|
| the hub | `https://argus-hub.90.147.174.30.myip.cloud.infn.it` |
| its API | `https://argus-hub-api.90.147.174.30.myip.cloud.infn.it` |
| sign-in (Keycloak, realm `argus`) | `https://keycloak.90.147.174.30.myip.cloud.infn.it` |
| privacy policy | `https://argus-hub.90.147.174.30.myip.cloud.infn.it/privacy.html` |

- **Sign-in**: the hub's Keycloak (*Keycloak login*) or Google. Keycloak accounts are created by an administrator in
  Keycloak's admin console (*Users*); what they may do in ARGUS is set in ARGUS.
- **The version running**: `<API>/v1/meta/version` says it, with the commit it was built from; the mobile app shows
  it under *About and diagnostics*.
- **Your data** lives in the installation's database and its attachments and portability volumes.

## New versions

A release is a version tag (`v1.35.21`, for example). It:

1. runs the backend tests in the image that will be shipped, and builds the web app;
2. builds and publishes the images (the base images come from mirrors of Docker's images, so Docker Hub's download
   limits do not stop a release);
3. commits *Deploy <version>* to `main`, which Argo CD rolls out to the cluster. If the new version is not running a
   few minutes later, ask Argo CD to refresh the application;
4. builds the mobile app: an **APK** attached to the GitHub release, and an **app bundle** for Google Play (sent to the
   *internal testing* track when the Play service account is configured).

The mobile app installed from GitHub offers the newer release on its home screen; the Google Play version is updated
by Google Play. The two are signed differently: a phone keeps one or the other.

## Cleanup, backups and recovery

Unused container images are removed from the servers every two days, and finished portability files after one day:
download a portability archive you want to keep before then. Cleanup is housekeeping, not a backup.

Whoever runs the installation should write down what is backed up (database, attachments, configuration and
secrets), how often and for how long, how to restore it, and when a restore was last tested. A portability export
and a database backup serve different purposes (see *Export and import*).

## For operators

The Helm chart, secrets, storage and upgrades are described in the repository's `k8s/README.md` and
`docs/operations.md`. Keep credentials out of this guide, and keep the administrators' and support contacts beside
the deployment procedures.
