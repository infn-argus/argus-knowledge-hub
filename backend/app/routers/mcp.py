"""The hub as an MCP server.

Served from this application rather than as a separate process, because
everything it needs is already here: the same Bearer token, the same
permission check, the same workspace scoping. A second service would have
to reimplement all three and could get them subtly wrong.

The transport is streamable HTTP: one POST carrying a JSON-RPC request,
answered with JSON. There is no server-initiated stream — these tools
answer immediately — so GET is refused, which the specification allows.
