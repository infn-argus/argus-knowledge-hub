"""What a person may do in a workspace.

One function answers it, and require_permission() is the only caller that
matters — every router keeps the call it already had. Grants come from
three places and are unioned, never intersected:

* role bindings on the user,
* role bindings on any group the user belongs to,
* a legacy Membership row, which still resolves so that access granted
  before roles existed doesn't quietly disappear at deploy time.
