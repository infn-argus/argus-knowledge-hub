"""Reading a photograph of equipment into a draft object.

Somebody standing in front of a rack with a phone knows more than they
can be bothered to type. A photograph carries the type of thing, its
manufacturer, often a model number, and — if the label is in shot — the
object key that ties it to everything already recorded about it.

What comes back is a draft for a form, not a record. The model is told
which object types this workspace actually has, so it cannot invent one,
and any key it reads is checked against the inventory rather than
believed: a key that matches is a real link, and a key that matches
nothing is shown as text somebody can correct.
