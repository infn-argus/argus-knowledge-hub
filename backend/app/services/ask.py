"""Answering a question from the hub's own knowledge.

This is the test ARGUS has to pass. The project's claim is that structured
knowledge answers questions a pile of documents cannot — "what has gone
wrong with this magnet before, and which procedure covers it" — and the
only honest way to find out is to let somebody ask, in their own words,
and watch which records the answer actually came from.

So the tool calls are not an implementation detail to hide. They are the
output: every call and every result is returned alongside the answer, and
a question that produced a confident paragraph from no tool calls at all
is a failure, however well it reads.

The tools are the MCP ones, called in process. The same eight tools an
external assistant gets, so what is learned here is true there too.
