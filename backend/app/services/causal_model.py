"""What a relation means for a failure.

The knowledge graph walks edges in both directions, which is right for "what is connected to this
magnet" and useless for "why did this magnet stop". A root-cause walk needs to know, for each kind
of edge, which way a failure travels and what it takes away with it, and that is a fact about the
relation's meaning, not about any one object.

Take `Control Device --provided by--> IOC`. It is stored from the device to the IOC, and a failure
travels the other way: when the IOC stops, the device loses its readout. `PS --powers--> Quadrupole`
is stored provider to dependent, and the failure travels the way the edge points. So each relation
type gets two facts:

  flows    which way a failure travels along the stored edge. `forward`: from the edge's source to its
           target. `reverse`: from the target to the source. `none`: the edge says what something *is*
           or where it came from (a configuration it was read from, a model it is an instance of),
           and no failure crosses it.
  carries  what the dependent loses.
             control       readout and command, but not its function. An IOC that stops does not stop
                           the ion pump it reads; it stops anyone seeing the pump.
             function      what the thing does. A chiller that stops cools nothing.
             permit        a condition that lets it run. Vacuum above a threshold does not break the RF,
                           it stops the RF being raised.
             degradation   part of something is lost. A screen station without its camera is not gone
                           but is no use.

`carries` matters as much as `flows`, because it decides where a failure can go next. A device that
has lost its IOC has lost *control*, and that is all it can pass on: to the asset it acts on, which
loses control too. It must not reach the lattice element the asset realises, because the pump is
still pumping. `follows()` says which losses may cross which edges.

Every relation type any importer writes must be classified here. A test enforces it, because an
unclassified relation is silently ignored by every walk, which is how a graph goes wrong quietly.
