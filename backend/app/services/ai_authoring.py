"""Drafting and reviewing a document, and filling in a ticket.

Three jobs, one principle: the model writes into a form, never into a
record. A draft lands in the editor where somebody edits it before
anything is saved; a review is a list of remarks, not a set of changes;
a ticket's fields arrive as values in the form somebody is already filling
in.

The ARGUS fields on a ticket are the reason this is worth doing at all.
argus_category, argus_impact, argus_detected_by and the cause-and-cure
fields are what the hub reasons over, and Jira never had them — so 524
imported tickets carry the answer only in their prose.
