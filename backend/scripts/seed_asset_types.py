"""Admin script: seed the object type catalogue.

The catalogue has two sets, seeded separately.

  global    the shared types (assets, products, vendors and locations: 59 of
            them), created once in a catalogue workspace and
            flagged global, so every workspace can use them and inherit from
            them. The objects of a global type are visible in every workspace,
            and editable only in the workspace that made them.

  beamline  one machine's own types (its structure, its control and what it
            costs: 44 of them), created in that beamline's workspace, hanging from the global ones.
            Its objects stay in that workspace.

  all       everything in one workspace, for a hub that has only one.

Safe to run again: an existing type keeps every attribute it has and gains any it
lacks, a type the EPIK8s importers made is adopted rather than duplicated, and a
type seeded under a former name (Equipment Item, Place) is renamed in place. Run
it before or after an import; the result is the same.

Nothing here runs when a workspace is created: a workspace that only holds
tickets has no use for object types in its tree.

Usage (from anywhere, with the backend's virtualenv and DATABASE_URL set):
  python backend/scripts/seed_asset_types.py global   <catalogue_workspace> [--dry-run]
  python backend/scripts/seed_asset_types.py beamline <workspace> --catalogue <catalogue_workspace> [--dry-run]
  python backend/scripts/seed_asset_types.py all      <workspace> [--dry-run]
  python backend/scripts/seed_asset_types.py <workspace> [--dry-run]       (same as: all)
