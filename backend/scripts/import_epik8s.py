"""Admin script: read an EPIK8s control configuration into a workspace.

Reads a beamline's deploy/values.yaml from disk and writes what it describes as
objects of the catalogue's types, each linked to what the file says it is tied to:

  Facility                the beamline
  Control Configuration   this file at this revision; everything below is declared in it
  IOC Template            the recipe an IOC is deployed from
  IOC                     the deployable unit, on its networks, from its template
  Control Device          the channel, axis or gauge that actually fails
  Access Point            the terminal server or address a device is reached through
  Control Network         a network an IOC is attached to
  Control Service         archiver, gateways, alarm server, logbook
  Storage Mount           an NFS mount or backup target
  Serial Line             one serial port of a converter, with the devices on it

Access Points are found in the inventory by address before any is made, so a Moxa
that is already an object is linked, not duplicated; --no-create-missing reports
the addresses nothing carries instead of making an object for each.

--infer-elements also makes what the channels are for, which the file never lists: the
ion pump behind GUNSIP01, the quadrupole and its power supply behind QUATB002, the
camera, a BPM's electronics, an LLRF chassis, a modulator. They are read from the
device metadata (devgroup, devfunc, devtype, template) and, for magnets, from the LNF
name code; a channel neither says anything about is counted and reported, not guessed
at. Each is marked `inferred` and says why, keeps anything a person adds to it, and
needs the catalogue's types (seeded first).

Each Access Point says what kind of endpoint it is (a serial converter, a host, an
instrument, a camera), read from the class prefix of INFN's DNS naming convention and, for
a bare IP, from a port in Moxa's 4001-4999 range, with the evidence beside it. Each device
on a port of a converter is `on line` a Serial Line that is `port of` the converter's
Access Point.

--it-workspace <workspace> also makes the IT equipment the hostnames name, in that
site-wide workspace: the converter behind a `sc…` host, a server behind `pl…`, a console
behind `pw…co…`, flagged global and keyed by the fully qualified name, so two beamlines
that reach one host share one object. Each Access Point is `implemented by` it.

The types are seeded first if they are not there: with --catalogue the shared ones
are used where they are and only this beamline's own are created here; a workspace
already seeded against a catalogue keeps using it; any other gets the whole
catalogue. Run it again after the file changes: it updates what the file says and
leaves what has been added since.

Usage (from anywhere, with the backend's virtualenv and DATABASE_URL set):
  python backend/scripts/import_epik8s.py <workspace_id> <values.yaml>
      [--catalogue <catalogue_workspace>] [--no-create-missing] [--infer-elements] [--it-workspace <workspace>] [--dry-run]
